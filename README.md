This is the server (back-end) side of our Amazin' project created by Talent Path's 'Quaran-Team!' of full stack developers.

The plan was to practice weekly agile sprints by creating an e-commerce product page(s) for 20-50 items in a very similar theme to that big one named after the giant river in South America.

Each team member has made contributions to both client (front - end) and server (back - end) sides of the project connecting their data to their components.

The client side can be found here _-_ GitHub Repo = https://github.com/Quaran-Team/client-Amazin .

And live deployed at ... {}.

We created the server in Java using Spring-Boot. Using Maven for our dependicies and Fly Way to manage our data migrations. 

Due to time constraints some parts are just static mocks, while others are fully dynamic.

To run it locally:
1- clone down the repo
2- run the program either in an ide (we used either intelli-J or vs code) by clicking the little green play button arrow for the file ApiApplication.java ... or via command line with mvn spring-boot:run

If updates are made to the data sql files run the commands 'mvn flyway:clean' followed by 'mvn clean' before starting the server.

If you get an error command not found MVN you will need to download and install it locally which can be done here: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
